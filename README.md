The mod "Extended Vehicle Maintenance" from FS19 returns to FS22 with new features!

With this script you will make the maintenance of your vehicle a lot more complex and actually have to think about when you want to repair damages of your vehicle.
Damages occur on every vehicle over time. Some of them you will be notified of in the help window, some you will have to find through a one-hour inspection. 
To start an inspection or repair the damages, you need to buy a pallet in the shop, drive close to it and then call up the maintenance menu. In this menu you can select how many damages you want to repair. You will also be shown how much a repair would cost with the current selection and how long it would take. 

Once a maintenance or inspection has been started, it will only be carried out during the working hours from 7:00 - 21:00 o'clock. However, if it falls within a time window when no work is being carried out, it will be paused until the morning.

The first time you start the game with this mod, the script looks at the current vehicle damage and adds the number of damages that would have caused this vehicle damage. These damages are already known, so they do not have to be found by an inspection and can be repaired straight away via the maintenance menu.

If you are playing with the latest version of the CVT_Addon mod, improper vehicle operation increases wear on the gearbox. Below 90% damage, the gearbox can be repaired for money (maximum 10.769,-) and a lot of time (maximum 11hrs) - above 90%, the gearbox must be completely replaced. This costs considerably more (15.000,-), but takes less time (7 hours)
