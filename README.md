## English description

The mod "Extended Vehicle Maintenance" from FS19 returns to FS22 with new features!

With this script you will make the maintenance of your vehicle a lot more complex and actually have to think about when you want to repair damages of your vehicle.
Damages occur on every vehicle over time. Some of them you will be notified of in the help window, some you will have to find through a one-hour inspection. 
To start an inspection or repair the damages, you need to buy a pallet in the shop, drive close to it and then call up the maintenance menu. In this menu you can select how many damages you want to repair. You will also be shown how much a repair would cost with the current selection and how long it would take. 

Once a maintenance or inspection has been started, it will only be carried out during the working hours from 7:00 - 21:00 o'clock. However, if it falls within a time window when no work is being carried out, it will be paused until the morning.

The first time you start the game with this mod, the script looks at the current vehicle damage and adds the number of damages that would have caused this vehicle damage. These damages are already known, so they do not have to be found by an inspection and can be repaired straight away via the maintenance menu.

If you are playing with the latest version of the CVT_Addon mod, improper vehicle operation increases wear on the gearbox. Below 90% damage, the gearbox can be repaired for money (maximum 10.769,-) and a lot of time (maximum 11hrs) - above 90%, the gearbox must be completely replaced. This costs considerably more (15.000,-), but takes less time (7 hours)

### Gameplay
#### Information
When you operate a vehicle, the help window informs you about the current condition of the vehicle.
This allows you to see the number of currently known damages and when the vehicle should be inspected for further hidden damages at the latest.
After an inspection, the damages found are added to the number of current damages.

![gameplay_en](https://github.com/Frvetz/FS22_RealisticDamageSystem/assets/76913845/1aa4307b-d2bc-463e-b6ce-e5efc6b34050)

Any damage, whether known or not, leads to a loss of engine power.
If the inspection is not carried out, consequences of the unknown damages must be expected. For example, the vehicle will stall if the engine load is too high and will not start properly if the automatic engine start is deactivated in the game settings.

#### Open maintenance menu
By default, the vehicle maintenance menu can be called up with CTRL + M when you are near a vehicle maintenance palette (available in the shop).

![menu_open_en](https://github.com/Frvetz/FS22_RealisticDamageSystem/assets/76913845/54e467e1-57e8-4b47-b27e-f66193e824a8)

#### Maintenance started
As soon as maintenance or similar has been started, you will be shown in the help window when it will be completed.

![repairing_en](https://github.com/Frvetz/FS22_RealisticDamageSystem/assets/76913845/ecc0363c-392b-4c5e-8e43-f77d041a0d45)

### Maintenance menu
In this window (CTRL + M) you can see a text that shows how many damages can be repaired in total, how much the repair will cost with the current selection and when it will be completed. 
The vehicle cannot be used during maintenance!

Below the text you can select how many damages should be repaired...

Select option -> Start repair -> Money is deducted from the account -> Vehicle is only ready for use again when the displayed time is reached.

An inspection can also be started, which would take one hour. After completion, the number of damages found is displayed.

#### CVT_Addon support
Due to the 'CVT_Addon' script, improper vehicle operation increases wear on the gearbox in vehicles with a variable (CVT) gearbox.
Below 90% damage, the gearbox can be repaired for money (maximum 10.769,-) and a lot of time (5-11hrs).
Above 90%, the gearbox must be completely replaced. This costs considerably more (15.000,-), but takes less time (7 hours).

![menu_cvt_en](https://github.com/Frvetz/FS22_RealisticDamageSystem/assets/76913845/51fded86-5663-402c-b369-c84b51eea224)

Before the gearbox repair is actually started, you will be shown how much it will cost and how long it will take, just to be on the safe side.

#### Maintenance paused - working hours
Once the maintenance/inspection has started, it will only be carried out during working hours (7:00 to 21:00).
However, if the maintenance/inspection falls within a time window in which no work is being carried out, it will be paused.
If the maintenance/inspection has to be paused with the current selection, this is displayed in an additional line of text in this window.
